    <h3> Her Story</h3>

    <p class="white-copy"> Sarah was born June 7th 1999 in the Brantford General Hospital. Her parents are strict yet loving european parents. Her father escaped Serbia with the hilarious real name of 'Dragan'. Her mother was born in Canada but is of Greek decent and her name is Antonia. She is the youngest of two behind her older sister Stephanie. Growing up, Sarah enjoyed a nice childhood in the quiet town of Brantford, Ontario. She went to Ecole Dufferin, a french immersion school for elementary. Later she continued her studies at Brantford Collegiate Institute (BCI) where she received her French Immersion bilingual certificate. It was at BCI where she learned of her love for Graphic Design.
         </p>

        <p>In her tenth year, Sarah took a media arts class not knowing much about it but liking the idea of the name. For the following two years she took the available graphic design classes the high school had to offer. She wanted to teach all of her life but after being convinced by her high school Graphic Design teacher to pursure this as a career, she just could not say no. Sarah is currently enrolled in her 2nd year at St. Clair College Centre for the Arts in the Graphic Design program. </p>
